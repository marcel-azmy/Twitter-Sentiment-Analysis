# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model leveraging HuggingFace Transformers, including pipelines, AutoModel, and AutoTokenizer. The workflow includes:

### - Data Preparation: 
Preprocessing and cleaning the Twitter dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
### - Model Implementation: 
Using HuggingFace's AutoModel and AutoTokenizer to build a sentiment analysis model.
### - Sentiment Classification: 
Implementing the model to accurately classify tweets as expressing either negative or positive sentiment.

## Tools and Libraries
### - HuggingFace Transformers: 
For model building and tokenization.
### - AutoModel: 
To automatically load and fine-tune pre-trained models.
### - AutoTokenizer: 
For efficient text tokenization.
