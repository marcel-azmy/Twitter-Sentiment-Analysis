# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing Twitter sentiment using HuggingFace Transformers. It involves the use of advanced NLP tools to classify tweets as either expressing negative or positive sentiment.

## Project Overview
In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model leveraging HuggingFace Transformers, including pipelines, AutoModel, and AutoTokenizer. The workflow includes:

# Data Preparation: Preprocessing and cleaning the Twitter dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
# Model Implementation: Using HuggingFace's AutoModel and AutoTokenizer to build a sentiment analysis model.
# Sentiment Classification: Implementing the model to accurately classify tweets as expressing either negative or positive sentiment.

##Tools and Libraries
# HuggingFace Transformers pipeline: For model building and tokenization.
# AutoModel: To automatically load and fine-tune pre-trained models.
# AutoTokenizer: For efficient text tokenization.
